<h2>General Description </h2><br />
<p>
    A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee.<br />
    It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a coffee cherry.
    Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit.
    Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans,
    they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans.
    The fruits; cherries or berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together.
